### How to contribute to this open source project

The Themify web extension is a simple and straight forward extension that changes basic elements of a web page to reflect a chosen color. We would be happy to accept contributions from contributors of any background. Please see below for types of contributions.

## Types of Contributions
* Add additional functionality to the themes: having the chosen color change more aspects of the given web page, implementing new ways for the extension to work.
* Add other functionality that would make the extension easier to use or more helpful.
* Report and fix bugs: this extension may not work with all web pages, making bugs known and contributing code to fix these issues are both great contributions.
* Documentation: There already exists some documentation but if new functionality is added, new documentation will also be needed. Additionally, translating these instructions and code into different languages helps open up availability of this project to more than just english speakers.

## Code Style
If editing an existing file, code style should match that which already exists within the file and more generally the coding style that the project has as a whole.
